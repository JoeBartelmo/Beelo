This readme is mainly for decks

I've decided to categorize based on key things that i hate about mainstream
databases for mtg.

Instead of having a different category for all of the different possible decks
(mardu control, esper control, ...) and having to populate one for each.

Instead we will have a set of root architypes for all of the generic decks, and
associate them with a color for their complete deck.

So we dont list out all versions of 'midrange' instead we just store midrange
and let the coloring in the database take care of the rest.
